        bio: `Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a lifelong technology enthusiast, and have passions in Archery and Axe throwing. I've been doing Software Development since 2016, with a particular interest in Web development and Optimization. One of my public side-projects is <a href='dankpods.net' target='_blank'>DankPods</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        I have worked at Dynatrace since I was in University, and have written (and rewritten) many of my own projects, as well as contributed to a number of GitHub projects. With a strong understanding of Web technologies and optimization of web frontends, I continue to refine my skillset and figure out better ways to create and optimize web frontends.
